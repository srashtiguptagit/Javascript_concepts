/* Setting the viewport */

/* The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for 
web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were 
too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web 
page to fit the screen. */
