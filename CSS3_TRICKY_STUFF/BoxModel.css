/* The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. */

    width: 320px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 5px solid gray;
    margin: 0;
  }
  
  
  /* Here is the calculation:
  320px (width)
  + 20px (left + right padding)
  + 10px (left + right border)
  + 0px (left + right margin)
  = 350px */

  /* To prevent this we have to set */
