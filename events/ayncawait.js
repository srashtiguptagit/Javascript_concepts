// async keyword in front of function always determine that this  function would return a promise
// await literally suspends the function execution until the promise settles, 
// and then resumes it with the promise result. That doesnâ€™t cost any CPU resources, 
// because the JavaScript engine can do other jobs in the meantime: execute other scripts, handle events, etc.
